This chat system reimagines how people can communicate online by building entirely on capability-based security principles instead of traditional user accounts. When someone creates a chat room, they receive a special URL that grants them the power to create "participations." Each participation manifests as a unique URL that enables sending messages under a specific name in that chat.

The system works through simple URL sharing rather than accounts and passwords. To add someone to a chat, the creator generates a participation URL for a chosen name and shares it through any preferred channel. Anyone with that URL can then send messages appearing under that name, and if multiple people have the same URL, they'll all appear as that participant. This eliminates the need for user authentication while maintaining a clean way to manage who can speak and under what names.

The design extends naturally to delegation of capabilities. Chat creators can generate delegate URLs that grant others limited power to create new participations. These delegate capabilities can be constrained in various ways - allowing someone to add only a specific number of participants, create temporary participations that expire, or add participants matching certain name patterns. All security and permissions are embedded in the URLs themselves, eliminating the need for complex role management systems.

This approach aligns with REST architectural principles and capability-based security models, where possessing a URL grants specific, well-defined powers that can be delegated and constrained flexibly. The result is a simple yet powerful system where chat participation and management happen entirely through sharing and using capability URLs, making it easy to understand and use while maintaining fine-grained control over permissions.
