Swash is the name for one aspect of the system. It is related to the user experience, it's related to input methods, it's related to temporality, and it's related to the idea of a shell. It's also a short and sweet domain name and it rhymes with bash.

There's a history to the domain name it used to be an app for typing and thinking that had no permanent storage at all. This was very nice and generative and I wanna somehow respect that. One way is for example by not requiring users to have an account. You should be able to just go to the website and immediately do something that doesn't need to be tied to your account it doesn't need to be saved permanently it's just some stuff it's just words it's just thinking.

Swash is related to waves and tides and I think this makes sense for conversation, you know the concept of a chat is a bit like waves coming in and out, the swash of the conversation going back-and-forth.
