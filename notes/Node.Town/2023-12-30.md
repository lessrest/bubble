I broke my arm the other day. This gives me some motivation to make a working program, because I need it. I want to be able to chat with my brother over text via voice in a way that also lets us work with AI tools.

I set up an instance on [[Fly.io]] but it's not really useful. I want to get [[ActivityPub]] working in real time with [[Speech Recognition]] and [[Software Agents]].

Now I set up the [[swa.sh]] domain as an alias to the Fly.io instance.

I notice that I'm a bit afraid of running the speech recognition thing because I have a felt sense of fear that it's spamming my database, etc. This may be true. I'm not sure exactly what it does.

It would be really cool if I saw an affordance on my thing that said like create a new chat or whatever, and then like I could do that and it would take me to like something like an empty graph and there could invite people or you know like I could create an identity you know or like create participant, so I would create a participant for myself and then I would create a participant for Daniel and that would give me a link that I could send to Daniel which would like take him to the chat with the Daniel identity. We can then each do Voice input and they would show up like on a timeline in real time so a real time transcription appearing as chat.

I also wanna be able to configure a secrets like API keys through the graph database because I set up a persistent volume on fly.io so I can use that to store the secrets instead of environment variables. 

At some point I will also need to handle replication so multiple instances of the app running at the same time for in a rolling deploys and for just redundancy and I wonder how that is gonna work that is very interesting. It should just be two instances with different repositories but synchronizing amongst each other and they don't need to synchronize temporary graphs they only need to synchronize the transaction graphs or the persistent graphs. And they could also connect to each other with live sockets web sockets I mean to expose each other's agents so it's just an application of the mesh.
