# write turtle defns here that define prefixes for e.g. prov
# and then define skos:prefLabel for the properties and classes we use
# formatted like e.g. "was derived from"@en, etc etc
# so not using camel case, just good english phrases
# and changing e.g. generatedAtTime to "was generated at time"@en
# to have a consistent grammatical phrase style
