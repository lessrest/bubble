# N3 Web Framework

A semantic web framework that uses N3 rules to handle HTTP requests and implement ActivityPub nodes. Built with Deno, N3.js, and the EYE reasoner.

## Features

- üåê **Declarative HTTP Routing** - Define routes using N3 rules
- üîç **Semantic Processing** - Handle requests through RDF and logical inference  
- ü§ù **ActivityPub Support** - Build federated social applications
- üß™ **Test Driven** - Comprehensive test suite using Deno's testing framework

## Quick Start

```bash
# Install dependencies
deno task cache

# Run the tests
deno task test

# Start the server
deno task serve
```

## Feature Progress

### Implemented ‚úÖ
- HTTP Request to RDF conversion
- N3 rule-based request handling
- Declarative routing with N3 patterns
- Basic ActivityPub inbox (GET/POST)
- RDFS reasoning and type inference
- Comprehensive test suite with RDF assertions

### Coming Soon üöß
- Activity validation
- Outbox implementation
- Federation support

When you start the server, it exposes a simple ActivityPub inbox implementation at `http://localhost:8000/users/alice/inbox`. The configuration is split into two files:

1. `ground-facts.ttl` - Defines the basic ActivityPub structure:
```n3
@base <http://localhost:8000/>.
@prefix ap: <http://www.w3.org/ns/activitystreams#>.

</users/alice> a ap:Person;
  ap:inbox </users/alice/inbox>.

</users/alice/inbox> a ap:Collection.
```

2. `rules/inbox.n3` - Contains the N3 rules for handling requests

The `@base` directive in the ground facts sets the base IRI to resolve relative paths, so `/users/alice/inbox` becomes `http://localhost:8000/users/alice/inbox`. The inbox implementation can:

- Accept POST requests with new ActivityPub Notes
- Return the collection contents via GET requests
- Maintain the collection items between requests

You can test it with curl:

```bash
# Get the inbox contents
curl http://localhost:8000/users/alice/inbox

# Post a new Note
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/turtle" \
  -d '@prefix as: <http://www.w3.org/ns/activitystreams#>. 
      <#body> a as:Note; as:content "Hello Alice!".' \
  http://localhost:8000/users/alice/inbox
```

## Example: ActivityPub Inbox with N3 Rules

This example shows how to implement an ActivityPub inbox using N3 rules. N3 rules are logical implications of the form:
`{ condition } => { conclusion }` where both sides are RDF graph patterns.

The framework:
1. Converts HTTP requests into RDF graphs
2. Applies N3 rules to match patterns and generate responses
3. Converts response graphs back to HTTP responses

When the response includes RDF graphs in the `http:body` predicate, they are automatically serialized as Turtle in the HTTP response body.

```n3
# First, declare our namespaces
@prefix http: <http://www.w3.org/2011/http#>.
@prefix as: <http://www.w3.org/ns/activitystreams#>.

# Rule 1: GET request to an inbox
# When we match:
{
  # An HTTP request...
  ?request http:href ?collection;  # ...to some URL
          http:method "GET" .      # ...using GET method
  
  # And that URL identifies a Collection
  ?collection a as:Collection.
} => {
  # Then generate a response...
  ?response a http:Response;
    http:respondsTo ?request;     # ...for this request
    http:responseCode 200;        # ...with 200 OK status
    http:contentType "application/turtle";  # ...as Turtle
    # Include a graph in the response body
    http:body { 
      ?collection a as:Collection 
    } .
}.

# Rule 2: Include collection items in GET response
# This rule adds to the previous response
{
  ?request http:href ?collection;
    http:method "GET" .
  
  # Find the existing response
  ?response a http:Response ;
    http:respondsTo ?request .

  # Match any items in the collection
  ?collection ap:items ?item .
} => {
  # Add those items to the response body
  ?response http:body { 
    ?collection ap:items ?item 
  } .
}.

# Rule 3: POST new items to the inbox
{
  # Match POST request
  ?request http:href ?collection;
          http:method "POST";
          http:body ?object .     # Extract posted content
  
  # Verify collection exists
  ?collection a as:Collection .    
  # Verify posted content is a Note
  ?object a as:Note .
} => {
  # Create success response
  ?response a http:Response;
    http:respondsTo ?request;
    http:responseCode 201;
    http:body "Activity accepted" .

  # Add the Note to the collection
  ?collection as:items ?object .
}.
```

The framework handles all the RDF conversion:
- Incoming requests become RDF graphs with `http:Request` type
- Posted content in Turtle format is parsed into the request graph
- Response graphs are converted back to HTTP responses
- RDF graphs in `http:body` are serialized as Turtle

This declarative approach lets us focus on the logic of what should happen rather than how to implement it. The rules engine handles matching patterns and generating the appropriate responses.

HTTP requests are represented as RDF:

```turtle
_:request a http:Request;
    http:path "/api/users/123";
    http:method "GET".
```

## Key Features

- Clean separation between routing logic and handlers
- Pattern matching on URLs through N3 rules
- Content negotiation via semantic rules
- ActivityPub inbox/outbox handling
- Session-based request contexts

## Development

```bash
# Run tests
deno task test

# Start dev server
deno task dev

# Run specific test suites
deno task test:server
deno task test:rules
```
