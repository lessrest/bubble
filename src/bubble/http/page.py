"""Page generation: Where structure meets style in the digital realm.

In the beginning was the markup, and the markup was HTML. But raw HTML
was too verbose, too error-prone, too... 1995. So we build abstractions,
creating a dance of context managers and string builders that transform
our intentions into valid HTML.

Historical note: The first web browser was also an editor - Tim Berners-Lee's
WorldWideWeb (later renamed Nexus). We've been trying to recapture that
unified read-write vision of the web ever since.
