"""Git integration: Where time becomes a DAG and every commit tells a story.

As Linus Torvalds once quipped, "Talk is cheap. Show me the code."
But here we are, talking about code that talks to Git, which talks
about code. It's turtles all the way down.

Historical note: Git was born out of necessity and spite when BitKeeper
withdrew free use from the Linux kernel project. Never underestimate
the power of spite in software development.
