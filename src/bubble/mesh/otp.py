"""Open Telecom Platform (OTP) inspired patterns for our actor system.

In the beginning, there was Erlang OTP, and it was good. So good that
we're shamelessly inspired by it here. But this isn't your grandfather's
OTP - this is OTP for the semantic web age, where every actor has a URI
and every message is a graph.

Historical note: The name OTP comes from Erlang's telecom origins at Ericsson.
We keep the name as a tribute, even though our actors are more likely to be
processing RDF graphs than routing phone calls. Progress?
