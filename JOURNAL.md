## November 21, 2024 - Major Progress on RDF Web Framework

We've made significant strides in building a semantic web framework that uses N3 rules for HTTP request handling. Here's what we've accomplished:

### Core RDF Infrastructure
- Built a robust test suite using Deno, N3.js, and the EYE reasoner
- Implemented clean RDF parsing and serialization
- Created helper functions for RDF assertions and queries
- Demonstrated RDFS reasoning with type inference and transitive relationships

### HTTP Request Handler with N3 Rules
Successfully created a declarative web request handler that:
- Converts HTTP requests into RDF graphs
- Uses N3 rules to determine responses
- Supports pattern matching on paths
- Handles different response types and status codes

The system now uses session-based URNs to provide unique contexts for request processing, ensuring clean separation between different requests.

### ActivityPub Integration (In Progress)
Started work on ActivityPub support:
- Basic inbox POST handling with semantic rules
- Activity processing using RDF representations
- Currently debugging collection updates
- Working toward a fully semantic social network node

### Example Domain Model
Built a playful test domain using Tom & Jerry characters:
- Demonstrates class hierarchies (Pet -> Rat/Eel/Owl)
- Shows relationship inference
- Provides concrete examples for testing

### Technical Achievements
1. **Declarative Routing**: HTTP routes are now defined purely in N3 rules:
```n3
{
  ?request http:path "/hello".
} => {
  [] http:responseCode 200;
     http:body "Hello, World!".
}.
```

2. **Clean RDF Representations**: HTTP requests are cleanly modeled in RDF:
```turtle
_:request a http:Request;
    http:path "/api/users/123";
    http:method "GET".
```

3. **Semantic Processing**: Using N3 rules for request handling enables:
- Pattern matching on URLs
- Content negotiation
- Response generation
- All through declarative rules

### Next Steps
- Complete ActivityPub inbox implementation
- Add more sophisticated content negotiation
- Implement outbox and activity distribution
- Build more complex routing patterns

### Latest Achievement: RDF Graph Responses
We've successfully implemented the ability to return RDF graph responses from our HTTP handlers. The server can now:
- Return complete RDF graphs as responses
- Use N3 rules to construct response graphs
- Validate response graphs with SPARQL-like queries in tests
- Return proper Content-Type headers for Turtle

This is demonstrated in our new test case that verifies an inbox GET returns a proper ActivityStreams Collection:

```turtle
</users/alice/inbox> a as:Collection;
   rdfs:label "Inbox".
```

The framework is evolving into a powerful platform for building semantic web applications with clean separation of concerns and declarative behavior specification.
